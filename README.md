# MedGuard 🛡️

> An AI-powered second-opinion tool to verify the necessity of medical tests prescribed by hospitals.

## 🌐 Why MedGuard?

In many healthcare systems, diagnostic tests are sometimes prescribed not out of medical necessity—but for profit. This leads to:

- Unnecessary financial burden
- Patient anxiety
- Resource waste in medical systems

**MedGuard** helps patients get a **second opinion** from AI to understand whether the suggested tests are actually required—based on symptoms, medical history, and context.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- ✅ Takes in **prescribed tests**, **patient symptoms**, and optionally **doctor notes**
- 🤖 Uses AI to **analyze** whether each test is medically justified
- 🔍 Flags potentially **unnecessary or low-priority** tests
- 📄 Provides **reasoning** behind each decision for transparency

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (backend logic)
- **LLMs** (Locally or via OpenAI API)
- **Streamlit** (UI for demo and testing)
- **scikit-learn** (optional for structured rule-based checks)
