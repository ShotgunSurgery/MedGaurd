<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

MedGaurdl is an open-source health emergency alert and medical record platform built to empower users with privacy-first, decentralized control over their health data.

Imagine you're unconscious in a public place — your MedGaurdl ID can help first responders get just the right info securely. Or you're switching doctors — share records with one click, no corporate middlemen.

MedGaurdl aims to:
- Create secure medical IDs linked to essential health info
- Allow trusted access to records in emergencies
- Respect privacy with strong encryption and decentralized data handling

It is designed for developers, researchers, and health-tech enthusiasts who care about **transparency (openness)**, **security**, and **accessibility** in healthcare systems.
